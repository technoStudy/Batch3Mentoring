- What we see VS what Selenium see on a chrome browser (right click -> inspect)

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript are what most webpages made of.
     * HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
     * HTML is used for structure and content of a webpage
     * CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet
     * CSS is to style/beautify a webpage
     * JS stands for JavaScript
     * JS is used for coding behaviours of a webpage

- An HTML document has mainly two parts:
  * HEAD : contains the information about the document (title of the page, meta tags, JS and CSS imports, etc)
  * BODY : contains the actual content of the document (text, image, video, buttons, dropdown lists, etc)
