- how to create an HTML document on IntelliJ and to run it
  * change title and body text (Hello world!)
  * run the html file as a file

- HTML is made of tags (and attributes attached to the tags)
  * Browser will ignore tabs, multiple spaces, enters
  * tags and attributes names are NOT case-sensitive

- Start(opening) tag < > and end(closing) tag </ >
  * i.e.  <b>some text here</b>
  * < />
  * not all tags has closing tags, i.e. <hr> or <br>

- attributes are written within the angle brackets of a tag
  * multiple attributes can be added to a tag
  * most of the attributes takes values after = sign followed by either "" or ''
  * we leave a space (not a comma) between attributes
  * no compile time error like in Java. html just ignores whatever it cannot understand. Be careful with the tag names.
  * <hr width="75%">

- parent, child and sibling tags
  * For example: <i> and <b> tags
